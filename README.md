## üöÄ Recommendations

- **Disable the R7 M360 dGPU** in BIOS to avoid issues (macOS will only use the Intel HD 520).  
- Keep OpenCore and kexts up to date.  
- AirportItlwm provides stable Wi-Fi support, but for native macOS features like **AirDrop/Handoff**, a **Broadcom card** is still recommended.
